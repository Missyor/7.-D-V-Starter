# Task 1 
# Create code to print your own name 
print("Aoife")

 

# Task 2 
# Create a variable called personAge that asks, and allows, the user to input in their age. Make sure the age is stored as a number 
personAge = int(input("What age are you? "))
 

# Task 3 
# Create a variable called personAge that asks, and allows, the user to input in their age. Make sure the age is stored as a number. Create a new variable called dogYears. When dogYears is printed, we want it to calculate a person's age in dog years. This should be the person's age multiplied by 7. 
personAge = int(input("What age are you? "))
dogYears = personAge * 7
print(dogYears)

# Task 4 
# Repeat Task 3 but, this time, write code so that if you are given a dog's age you can find their human age
